# First Person Elm

[![First Person Elm](public/screenshot.jpg)][live demo]

This is a demo of using the [Elm][elm] language [package][elm-explorations/webgl] for [WebGL][webgl], combined with [Elm ports] and the browser [Fullscreen] and [Pointer Lock] APIs, to create a first person navigation experience in the browser.

## Demo

Check out the [live demo]! It has been tested on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.

## Attribution

This was inspired by an [original demo] by [evancz]. That project uses an old version of Elm, so it was brought up to date for Elm 0.19 with the Elm WebGL package's existing first person [example].

Since the package example is an illustration of the package's capabilities alone, it doesn't include pointer movement or fullscreen support.

The crate texture came from the [elm-explorations/webgl] example, and the ground texture came from [Open Game Art].

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Elm App]. You can install it with:

```sh
npm install -g create-elm-app
```

Then you can run the development server with:

```sh
elm-app start
```

View the app by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
